    "text": "The Tongass National Forest is renowned for its high primary productivity, carbon storage, and natural beauty. Unfortunately, many areas of the forest have been heavily logged within the past 75 years, and recent legislation threatens more of its trees with the axe. Our study wants to examine the effect deforestation has on streams within the Tongass in order to gauge its effects on the region’s many waterways. We gathered streamflow and water temperature data recorded by USGS National Water Information System from two different streams - one from a previously deforested watershed, and one from a relatively undisturbed watershed. With that data, we constructed graphs that compared the two streams’ water temperatures and streamflows, as well as stream flashiness. The flashiness and overall streamflow for Staney Creek was higher, while water temperature for Hatchery Creek was higher. This lends credence to the notion that deforestation results in higher and more flashier streamflows than old-growth forests. However, we were unable to find a positive correlation between deforestation and stream temperature, rather the exact opposite. Regardless of the water temperature results, our findings still lend additional support for the conservation of the Tongass. Further studies on both other aspects of the forest, as well as different measures of water quality, can be conducted in order to find further evidence to equate deforestation with declines in environmental health.\n\n\n\nThe Tongass National Forest is the largest national forest in the United States, covering nearly seventeen million acres. That covers a majority of the Alaska Panhandle and is dispersed over hundreds of islands. These islands form part of what is referred to as the Inside Passage, which is the coastal seaway that runs along much of the the North Pacific coast and is often sheltered by many islands and fjords (Smith 2019). It has long been a place of great importance to a variety of Native American peoples, most notably the Tlingit and Haida peoples (Elfar 2024). Out of all these features the Tongass National Forest possesses, arguably the most notable is that it also houses some of the most expansive tracts of old-growth temperate rainforest left on Earth. Temperate rainforests fulfill a variety of ecosystem services, such as carbon storage, outdoor recreation, and monitoring water quality (Brandt et al. 2014). The rainforests within the Tongass are areas of immense primary productivity and critical habitat for grey wolves, black and brown bears, various seabirds, and as spawning grounds for many different species of salmon (Noss 2021). These islands also display a high level of endemism among its wildlife, much more so than other habitats found at high-altitude ecosystems (Androski et al. 2024). It is also a major carbon sink - one of the largest in the United States, holding around 2.7 Pg of carbon (DellaSala, Gorelik, and Walker 2022). Half of that is stored in productive old-growth forests, while just 4.8% of that is stored in young growth forests.\nFor over three-quarters of a century, the Tongass has been subjected to industrial logging for its rich stands of western hemlock, sitka spruce, and different cedar species. Many areas - such as Prince of Wales Island - have since been subjected to heavy clearcut logging. In response, the Roadless Rule was enacted in 2001, which forbade both new road construction as well as new logging operations from being conducted. However, this protection has come under fire many times during the past nearly 25 years, most notably during both Trump administrations. Early in March, Trump issued two executive orders allowing for more logging within the United States’ national forests, which itself came after his suspension of the Roadless Rule in Alaska (Soliman 2025). The difference in the ecology between the remaining old-growth forest and the new secondary forest created by logging cannot be understated. It takes hundreds of years for forests in the Tongass to reach the level of biodiversity and ecological complexity commonly exhibited by old-growth tracts (Alaback 1982). Additionally, the existence of old, large trees is crucial to the formation of nurse logs, which themselves are vital for the germination and initial growth of young trees (Woods, Maleta, and Ortmann 2021). Both coho and cutthroat salmon, two popular sporting fishes in the region, are also sensitive to the stream changes that deforestation threats to enact (Moore et al. 2024).\nThe method of logging in southeast Alaska, clearcutting, has long been the primary method of timber harvesting in the region and continues to be so. This has long-lasting and far-reaching impacts on many different parts of the ecosystem. In this examination of raw data collected throughout the Tongass, we want to compare and contrast the differences in water quality and water discharge between two streams on the Prince of Wales Island; one in a watershed that was heavily logged, and one that is in a relatively preserved watershed. Research from earlier studies have suggested that logging increases peak flow discharge, decreases discharge during times of low flow, and increases maximum stream temperatures (Naman et al. 2024). Watershed deforestation also runs the risk of introducing increased nutrient and sediment loads (Noteboom, Seidou, and Lapen 2021). By doing so, we hope to illustrate how important protecting the Tongass National Forest is to the health of the rainforest ecosystem and further champion its designation as a land under the protection of the Roadless Rule.\n\n\n\nWe anticipate that streamflow, stream “flashiness” (referring to the amount of high discharge exhibited during times of peak flow, such as in high rains), and water temperature will be higher in Staney Creek than in Hatchery Creek. With its younger, secondary forest, the Staney Creek subwatershed will have less developed root systems than the Hatchery Creek subwatershed, with its old-growth forest. That means that less precipitation will be absorbed by the root system in the Staney Creek subwatershed, resulting in more runoff entering the stream. This will result in higher overall streamflows, and higher flashiness during times of high rainfall. With its less dense and less developed canopy, Staney Creek should have less shade cover as well, resulting in higher temperature readings as more sunlight hits the water.\n\n\n\nThe two chosen stream sites were found using three tools: the USGS National Water Information System map, an ArcGIS map showing timber harvests in the Tongass, and the USGS National Map Viewer. The USGS NWIS map showed different water monitoring sites across the nation, including a few in the Tongass. The ArcGIS map showed which areas in the Tongass had been logged (Heinrichs 2020), and the National Map Viewer had a layer that showed subwatersheds across the United States (USGS 2025a). All three were compared to find two USGS sites: one that was within a heavily deforested watershed and one that was in a relatively undisturbed watershed.\nThe two chosen USGS sites were 15081497 at Staney Creek (USGS 2025b) and 15086225 at Hatchery Creek (USGS 2025c). Staney Creek is located within a watershed that was heavily deforested in the 1970’s, and is home to widespread secondary forest. Hatchery Creek is mostly old-growth rainforest, barring some tracts of secondary forest resulting from logging during the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. For each, daily water discharge rates (in cubic feet per second) and daily water temperature readings (in degrees Celsius) were taken. The Staney Creek site started conducting water discharge measurements in 1989 and water quality measurements in 1990, while the Hatchery Creek site began conducting water discharge measurements in 2016 and water quality measurements in 2017. In order to have the data be graphed out in the same timeframe, only Staney Creek data taken from the date matching the earliest data entry from the Hatchery Creek data was used.\n\n\n\nWe constructed our graphs around three main aspects we wanted to examine: overall streamflow for each stream, the difference between discharge and baseflow for each stream, and the temperature readings for each stream. The overall streamflow and temperature readings were graphed with relatively simple linear methods, while the baseflow and discharge graphs for each stream were constructed using the Jakeman method from the grwat package in RStudio. This allowed us to find the “flashiness” of the streams, referring to the amount of high discharge exhibited during times of peak flow, such as in high rains. In order to take the differing sizes of the watersheds for each stream site into consideration, the cubic feet per second was divided by the size (in square miles) of their respective watersheds, which was also provided by the USGS NWIS. The temperatures and streamflows for both streams were then joined together to be plotted on the same graph. For the flashiness graphs, the Jakeman method was applied to each of the individual stream’s discharges.\n\n\n\nMost of our results were expected, with one notable exception. There was a noticeable difference in overall streamflow for both streams, with Staney Creek having almost consistently higher streamflow than Hatchery Creek from late October of 2016 to late April of 2025. This suggests a positive correlation between deforestation and streamflow. For the baseflow and discharge graphs for each stream, Stanley Creek had a substantially “flashier” discharge when compared to its baseflow than Hatchery Creek did. Surprisingly, the temperature readings for Hatchery Creek were consistently slightly higher than Staney Creek, particularly during the summer.\nBelow is the code used for our findings:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(janitor) #have to install package first\n\nWarning: package 'janitor' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dataRetrieval)\n\nWarning: package 'dataRetrieval' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(grwat)  #have to install package first\n\nWarning: package 'grwat' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWelcome to grwat package for the automatic hydrograph separation and hydrological time series analysis\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nStream Flow Measurements\n\nstaney_discharge &lt;-  readNWISdv(siteNumber = \"15081497\",\n                            parameterCd = \"00060\") %&gt;%\n  select(Date, Staney_Discharge = X_00060_00003)\n\nGET:https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/dv/?site=15081497&format=waterml%2C1.1&ParameterCd=00060&StatCd=00003&startDT=1851-01-01\n\n\n\nhatchery_discharge &lt;- readNWISdv(siteNumber = \"15086225\",\n                            parameterCd = \"00060\") %&gt;%\n  select(Date, Hatchery_Discharge = X_00060_00003)\n\nGET:https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/dv/?site=15086225&format=waterml%2C1.1&ParameterCd=00060&StatCd=00003&startDT=1851-01-01\n\n\n\nhatchery_discharge[, c(\"Hatchery_Discharge\")] &lt;- hatchery_discharge[, c(\"Hatchery_Discharge\")] / 39\n\n\nfiltered_staneydischarge &lt;- staney_discharge %&gt;%\n  filter(Date &gt;= as.Date(\"2016-10-26\") & Date &lt;= as.Date(\"2025-04-23\"))\n\n\nfiltered_staneydischarge[, c(\"Staney_Discharge\")] &lt;- filtered_staneydischarge[, c(\"Staney_Discharge\")] / 48.9\n\n\ndischarge &lt;- full_join(filtered_staneydischarge, hatchery_discharge, by = \"Date\") %&gt;%\n  select(where(~ !all(is.na(.))))\n\n\nslice_head(discharge, n = 20)\n\n         Date Staney_Discharge Hatchery_Discharge\n1  2016-10-26        1.8813906          3.4358974\n2  2016-10-27        1.4989775          2.5205128\n3  2016-10-28        1.2801636          1.8435897\n4  2016-10-29        1.1124744          1.3897436\n5  2016-10-30        0.9918200          1.1051282\n6  2016-10-31        0.8957055          0.9076923\n7  2016-11-01        0.8629857          0.7948718\n8  2016-11-02        1.1145194          0.8128205\n9  2016-11-03       17.6891616         12.0512821\n10 2016-11-04       28.2208589         20.6410256\n11 2016-11-05       34.3558282         24.1025641\n12 2016-11-06        9.9591002         19.9487179\n13 2016-11-07        8.3435583         12.0769231\n14 2016-11-08       11.7586912         11.2820513\n15 2016-11-09       25.1533742         12.1025641\n16 2016-11-10       29.8568507         17.7948718\n17 2016-11-11       17.3210634         18.6666667\n18 2016-11-12       15.5214724         14.5641026\n19 2016-11-13       15.3374233         11.2051282\n20 2016-11-14       14.7034765         10.3589744\n\n\nFigure 1.

Above is a graph of temperature readings for Staney Creek and Hatchery Creek, taken between 2017 and 2025.\n\n\n\nOur results show clear differences between Staney Creek (the disturbed site) and Hatchery Creek (the undisturbed site), especially in terms of streamflow. The difference between the baseflow and overall discharge for Hatchery Creek, as seen in Figure 7, is much less than the difference in baseflow and overall discharge for Staney Creek, as seen in Figure 8. This is partially due to the spikes in discharge Staney Creek experiences, which is a result of its high flashiness. This likely reflects the long-term effects of deforestation in the area. In the aftermath of an old-growth forest being cleared, when secondary forest takes its place, there’s often less vegetation and living root networks to absorb rainwater, which can lead to more surface runoff. Subsequently, streams in these areas tend to have bigger spikes in streamflow during periods of high precipitation, as well as higher streamflows overall. This pattern suggests that the disturbed watershed responds more intensely to precipitation, which could increase erosion and make habitats less stable.\nAccording to the water temperature readings shown in Figure 9, both creeks show similar seasonal trends, with temperatures rising in the summer and falling in the winter. However, Staney Creek sometimes has almost consistently cooler temperatures than Hatchery Creek, especially during the summer, which was surprising. Disturbed areas usually have warmer water because there’s less shade from trees. This difference might be explained by factors like stream depth, groundwater input, or forest regrowth providing some shade.\nThese findings mostly line up with a previous study examining the effect deforestation has on stream quality (Naman et al. 2024). Our findings similarly suggest that even decades after logging, deforestation continues to affect how a watershed functions. Streamflow patterns especially seem to be shaped by past disturbances, which is important to understand when making decisions about land and forest management.\nLimitations\nOne limitation of our analysis is that we only used daily data, which may miss short-term changes like sudden, hourslong spikes during heavy rain. We also didn’t include data on additional factors land cover that could’ve helped explain some of the streamflow differences more clearly. There was no consideration put towards land cover (such as in topology and aspect), river morphology, or the differences in precipitation each site tends to receive. The reach of Staney Creek the USGS site is located at is also wider than the site’s reach for Hatchery Creek, with the former being approximately 35 meters wide and the latter being 29 around meters wide.\nAdditionally, studies examining the two streams over a longer data frame would be more difficult to do. Hatchery Creek only started recording temperature and streamflow data within the past decade, while Staney Creek has been doing the same since the late 1980’s and early 1990’s.\nBroader Implications\nThis project shows how various data science tools can help us understand environmental change. By using public data and tidyverse packages in R, we were able to explore long-term trends in two different creeks. These kinds of analyses are incredibly valuable for conservation efforts and for understanding how ecosystems recover after human disturbances.\nNext Steps\nThe Tongass is an invaluable part of America’s biological heritage. Its conservation is therefore essential to ensure that its beauty and myriad ecosystem services are maintained for future generations and the Earth. Building on stream data, future studies could bring in data on rainfall, vegetation, or biodiversity to see how streamflow changes affect wildlife and forest recovery. Examining other aspects of stream quality, like sediment levels or fish populations, could also give us a better idea of how these watersheds are doing overall."

    "text": "The Tongass National Forest is the largest national forest in the United States, covering nearly seventeen million acres. That covers a majority of the Alaska Panhandle and is dispersed over hundreds of islands. These islands form part of what is referred to as the Inside Passage, which is the coastal seaway that runs along much of the the North Pacific coast and is often sheltered by many islands and fjords (Smith 2019). It has long been a place of great importance to a variety of Native American peoples, most notably the Tlingit and Haida peoples (Elfar 2024). Out of all these features the Tongass National Forest possesses, arguably the most notable is that it also houses some of the most expansive tracts of old-growth temperate rainforest left on Earth. Temperate rainforests fulfill a variety of ecosystem services, such as carbon storage, outdoor recreation, and monitoring water quality (Brandt et al. 2014). The rainforests within the Tongass are areas of immense primary productivity and critical habitat for grey wolves, black and brown bears, various seabirds, and as spawning grounds for many different species of salmon (Noss 2021). These islands also display a high level of endemism among its wildlife, much more so than other habitats found at high-altitude ecosystems (Androski et al. 2024). It is also a major carbon sink - one of the largest in the United States, holding around 2.7 Pg of carbon (DellaSala, Gorelik, and Walker 2022). Half of that is stored in productive old-growth forests, while just 4.8% of that is stored in young growth forests.\nFor over three-quarters of a century, the Tongass has been subjected to industrial logging for its rich stands of western hemlock, sitka spruce, and different cedar species. Many areas - such as Prince of Wales Island - have since been subjected to heavy clearcut logging. In response, the Roadless Rule was enacted in 2001, which forbade both new road construction as well as new logging operations from being conducted. However, this protection has come under fire many times during the past nearly 25 years, most notably during both Trump administrations. Early in March, Trump issued two executive orders allowing for more logging within the United States’ national forests, which itself came after his suspension of the Roadless Rule in Alaska (Soliman 2025). The difference in the ecology between the remaining old-growth forest and the new secondary forest created by logging cannot be understated. It takes hundreds of years for forests in the Tongass to reach the level of biodiversity and ecological complexity commonly exhibited by old-growth tracts (Alaback 1982). Additionally, the existence of old, large trees is crucial to the formation of nurse logs, which themselves are vital for the germination and initial growth of young trees (Woods, Maleta, and Ortmann 2021). Both coho and cutthroat salmon, two popular sporting fishes in the region, are also sensitive to the stream changes that deforestation threats to enact (Moore et al. 2024).\nThe method of logging in southeast Alaska, clearcutting, has long been the primary method of timber harvesting in the region and continues to be so. This has long-lasting and far-reaching impacts on many different parts of the ecosystem. In this examination of raw data collected throughout the Tongass, we want to compare and contrast the differences in water quality and water discharge between two streams on the Prince of Wales Island; one in a watershed that was heavily logged, and one that is in a relatively preserved watershed. Research from earlier studies have suggested that logging increases peak flow discharge, decreases discharge during times of low flow, and increases maximum stream temperatures (Naman et al. 2024). Watershed deforestation also runs the risk of introducing increased nutrient and sediment loads (Noteboom, Seidou, and Lapen 2021). By doing so, we hope to illustrate how important protecting the Tongass National Forest is to the health of the rainforest ecosystem and further champion its designation as a land under the protection of the Roadless Rule."

    "text": "The two chosen stream sites were found using three tools: the USGS National Water Information System map, an ArcGIS map showing timber harvests in the Tongass, and the USGS National Map Viewer. The USGS NWIS map showed different water monitoring sites across the nation, including a few in the Tongass. The ArcGIS map showed which areas in the Tongass had been logged (Heinrichs 2020), and the National Map Viewer had a layer that showed subwatersheds across the United States (USGS 2025a). All three were compared to find two USGS sites: one that was within a heavily deforested watershed and one that was in a relatively undisturbed watershed.\nThe two chosen USGS sites were 15081497 at Staney Creek (USGS 2025b) and 15086225 at Hatchery Creek (USGS 2025c). Staney Creek is located within a watershed that was heavily deforested in the 1970’s, and is home to widespread secondary forest. Hatchery Creek is mostly old-growth rainforest, barring some tracts of secondary forest resulting from logging during the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. For each, daily water discharge rates (in cubic feet per second) and daily water temperature readings (in degrees Celsius) were taken. The Staney Creek site started conducting water discharge measurements in 1989 and water quality measurements in 1990, while the Hatchery Creek site began conducting water discharge measurements in 2016 and water quality measurements in 2017. In order to have the data be graphed out in the same timeframe, only Staney Creek data taken from the date matching the earliest data entry from the Hatchery Creek data was used."

    "text": "We constructed our graphs around three main aspects we wanted to examine: overall streamflow for each stream, the difference between discharge and baseflow for each stream, and the temperature readings for each stream. The overall streamflow and temperature readings were graphed with relatively simple linear methods, while the baseflow and discharge graphs for each stream were constructed using the Jakeman method from the grwat package in RStudio. This allowed us to find the “flashiness” of the streams, referring to the amount of high discharge exhibited during times of peak flow, such as in high rains. In order to take the differing sizes of the watersheds for each stream site into consideration, the cubic feet per second was divided by the size (in square miles) of their respective watersheds, which was also provided by the USGS NWIS. The temperatures and streamflows for both streams were then joined together to be plotted on the same graph. For the flashiness graphs, the Jakeman method was applied to each of the individual stream’s discharges."

There was a noticeable difference in overall streamflow for both streams, with Staney Creek having almost consistently higher streamflow than Hatchery Creek from late October of 2016 to late April of 2025.

For the baseflow and discharge graphs for each stream, Stanley Creek had a substantially “flashier” discharge when compared to its baseflow than Hatchery Creek did.

    "text": "Our results show clear differences between Staney Creek (the disturbed site) and Hatchery Creek (the undisturbed site), especially in terms of streamflow. The difference between the baseflow and overall discharge for Hatchery Creek, as seen in Figure 7, is much less than the difference in baseflow and overall discharge for Staney Creek, as seen in Figure 8. This is partially due to the spikes in discharge Staney Creek experiences, which is a result of its high flashiness. This likely reflects the long-term effects of deforestation in the area. In the aftermath of an old-growth forest being cleared, when secondary forest takes its place, there’s often less vegetation and living root networks to absorb rainwater, which can lead to more surface runoff. Subsequently, streams in these areas tend to have bigger spikes in streamflow during periods of high precipitation, as well as higher streamflows overall. This pattern suggests that the disturbed watershed responds more intensely to precipitation, which could increase erosion and make habitats less stable.\nAccording to the water temperature readings shown in Figure 9, both creeks show similar seasonal trends, with temperatures rising in the summer and falling in the winter. However, Staney Creek sometimes has almost consistently cooler temperatures than Hatchery Creek, especially during the summer, which was surprising. Disturbed areas usually have warmer water because there’s less shade from trees. This difference might be explained by factors like stream depth, groundwater input, or forest regrowth providing some shade.\nThese findings mostly line up with a previous study examining the effect deforestation has on stream quality (Naman et al. 2024). Our findings similarly suggest that even decades after logging, deforestation continues to affect how a watershed functions. Streamflow patterns especially seem to be shaped by past disturbances, which is important to understand when making decisions about land and forest management.\nLimitations\nOne limitation of our analysis is that we only used daily data, which may miss short-term changes like sudden, hourslong spikes during heavy rain. We also didn’t include data on additional factors land cover that could’ve helped explain some of the streamflow differences more clearly. There was no consideration put towards land cover (such as in topology and aspect), river morphology, or the differences in precipitation each site tends to receive. The reach of Staney Creek the USGS site is located at is also wider than the site’s reach for Hatchery Creek, with the former being approximately 35 meters wide and the latter being 29 around meters wide.\nAdditionally, studies examining the two streams over a longer data frame would be more difficult to do. Hatchery Creek only started recording temperature and streamflow data within the past decade, while Staney Creek has been doing the same since the late 1980’s and early 1990’s.\nBroader Implications\nThis project shows how various data science tools can help us understand environmental change. By using public data and tidyverse packages in R, we were able to explore long-term trends in two different creeks. These kinds of analyses are incredibly valuable for conservation efforts and for understanding how ecosystems recover after human disturbances.\nNext Steps\nThe Tongass is an invaluable part of America’s biological heritage. Its conservation is therefore essential to ensure that its beauty and myriad ecosystem services are maintained for future generations and the Earth. Building on stream data, future studies could bring in data on rainfall, vegetation, or biodiversity to see how streamflow changes affect wildlife and forest recovery. Examining other aspects of stream quality, like sediment levels or fish populations, could also give us a better idea of how these watersheds are doing overall."

    "text": "The Tongass National Forest is renowned for its high primary productivity, carbon storage, and natural beauty. Unfortunately, many areas of the forest have been heavily logged within the past 75 years, and recent legislation threatens more of its trees with the axe. Our study wants to examine the effect deforestation has on streams within the Tongass in order to gauge its effects on the region’s many waterways. We gathered streamflow and water temperature data recorded by USGS National Water Information System from two different streams - one from a previously deforested watershed, and one from a relatively undisturbed watershed. With that data, we constructed graphs that compared the two streams’ water temperatures and streamflows, as well as stream flashiness. The flashiness and overall streamflow for Staney Creek was higher, while water temperature for Hatchery Creek was higher. This lends credence to the notion that deforestation results in higher and more flashier streamflows than old-growth forests. However, we were unable to find a positive correlation between deforestation and stream temperature, rather the exact opposite. Regardless of the water temperature results, our findings still lend additional support for the conservation of the Tongass. Further studies on both other aspects of the forest, as well as different measures of water quality, can be conducted in order to find further evidence to equate deforestation with declines in environmental health."

    "text": "We anticipate that streamflow, stream “flashiness” (referring to the amount of high discharge exhibited during times of peak flow, such as in high rains), and water temperature will be higher in Staney Creek than in Hatchery Creek. With its younger, secondary forest, the Staney Creek subwatershed will have less developed root systems than the Hatchery Creek subwatershed, with its old-growth forest. That means that less precipitation will be absorbed by the root system in the Staney Creek subwatershed, resulting in more runoff entering the stream. This will result in higher overall streamflows, and higher flashiness during times of high rainfall. With its less dense and less developed canopy, Staney Creek should have less shade cover as well, resulting in higher temperature readings as more sunlight hits the water."
